# Personal Portfolio Webpage

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website that makes me, my passions, and my interest in tech center-stage. It reflects my interests, projects I plan to make, and future visions for computer science. The site marries code and creativity and is equally a fun entrance and showcase of my first web development works.

## Features

* **Home Page**:  Welcomes visitors with a short intro, hobbies, and pictures (cooking, tech, movies).
* **Portfolio Page**: Lists what I am learning, projects to develop, and my goals in tech.
* **Fun Corner**: A personal section with my favorite emoji, dream job, favorite tech tool, and an inspirational quote by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
* **Skills Section**: Shows skills learned (Java, Python) and skills in programming (HTML, C++).
* **Navigation Bar**: Easy navigation between the Home and Portfolio pages.
* **Clean, Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS for accessibility and visual appeal.


## Goal

The goal of this project is to learn more about myself through web development and develop the skill for building a personal online presence. It reflects my creativity, interest in coding, and motivation to learn computer science.
